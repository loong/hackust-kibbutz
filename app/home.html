<h1>Welcome to Kibbutz!</h1>
<p>We plan to revolutionize the way charity functions. Our technology allows to improve the functioning of charities in 3 major ways:</p>
<li>Donors have a very transparent view of what happens with the money they have donated</li>
<li>They have a direct impact on what happens with their money thanks to voting power that they receive depending on the size of the donation</li>
<li>You can respond to catastrophes much faster as projects can be created and financed in a matter of seconds</li>
